    "\n",
    "A plant nursery in Cambridge is exprimentally cross-breeding two types of hibiscus flowers: blue and pink. The goal is to create an exotic flower whose petals are pink with a ring of blue on each. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of child plant that can result from this cross-breeding: \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Type 1: blue petals\n",
    "  - Type 2: pink petals \n",
    "  - Type 3: purple petals\n",
    "  - Type 4: pink petals with a blue ring on each (the desired effect). \n",
    "\n",
    "Out of 197 initial cross-breedings, the nursery obtained the following distribution over the four types of child plants: \n",
    "$$Y = (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4) = (125, 18, 20, 34)$$\n",
    "where $y_i$ represents the number of child plants that are of type $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nursery then consulted a famed Harvard plant geneticist, who informed them that the probability of obtaining each type of child plant in any single breeding experiment is as follows:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\theta+2}{4}, \\frac{1-\\theta}{4}, \\frac{1-\\theta}{4}, \\frac{\\theta}{4}.$$\n",
    "Unfortunately, the geneticist did not specify the quantity $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the nursery is interested in understanding how many cross-breeding they must perform, on average, in order to obtain a certain number of child plants with the exotic blue rings. To do this they must be able to compute $\\theta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The owners of the nursery, being top students in AM207, decided to model the experiment in hopes of discovering $\\theta$ using the results from their 197 initial experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "They chose to model the observed data using a multinomial model and thus calculated the likelihood to be:\n",
    "$$ p(y  \\vert  \\theta) \\propto (2+\\theta)^{y_1} (1-\\theta)^{y_2+y_3}  \\, \\theta^{y_4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Being good Bayesians, they also imposed a prior on $\\theta$, $\\rm{Beta}(a, b)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the posterior is:\n",
    "$$ p(\\theta \\vert  Y) = \\left( 2+\\theta \\right)^{y_1} (1-\\theta)^{y_2+y_3} \\, \\theta^{\n",
    "y_4} \\, \\theta^{a-1} \\, (1-\\theta)^{b-1}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the nursery owners are able to sample from the posterior, they would be understand the distribution of $\\theta$ and make appropriate estimates."

    "\n",
    "Realizing that it would be difficult to sample from the posterior directly and after being repeatedly frustrated by attempts of Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling for this model, the nursery owners decided to augment their model and hopefully obtain friendlier looking distribution that allows for easy sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "They augment the data with a new variable $z$ such that:\n",
    "$$z + (y_1 - z) = y_1.$$\n",
    "That is, using $z$, we are breaking $y_1$, the number of type I child plants, into two subtypes. Let the probability of obtain the two subtype be $1/2$ and $\\theta/4$, respectively. Now, we can interpret $y_1$ to be the total number of trials in a binomial trial. Thus, the new likelihood can be written as\n",
